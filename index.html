<p>Technically yes because my parents let me choose my own course, but my first choice was Multimedia arts but<br>
 when I saw how high the scholarship from Taguig for the course BSIT, I changed my mind because why not? I can use<br>
 my skills in game designing so I think it’s a good choice.</p>

<h3>I.T. Experience: Programming / Gaming / Others</h3>

I found it hard exercising my programming skills because as term changes, the languages changes too.</p>
