<h1> School Details</h1>

<h3>Senior High school:</h3><p> Asia Pacific College-Makati City</p>

<h3>Course:</h3><p> Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</p> 

<h3>Scholarship? Yes / No If yes,what type?</h3>

<p>Scholarship from the local government of Taguig and 50% Discount from APC because I graduated from Public School</p>

<h3>Did you choose this course? Yes / No</h3>
	

	
<p>Technically yes because my parents let me choose my own course, but my first choice was Multimedia arts but<br>
 when I saw how high the scholarship from Taguig for the course BSIT, I changed my mind because why not? I can use<br>
 my skills in game designing so I think it’s a good choice.</p>

<h3>I.T. Experience: Programming / Gaming / Others</h3>

<p>I didn’t have much time honing my skills in programming, but I am the game designer in 2 subjects last term. <br>
I found it hard exercising my programming skills because as term changes, the languages changes too.</p>

<h3>Hobbies / Interests / libangan:</h3>

<p>I make a lot of portraits when I am in the mood using graphite pencil, loves to sing and perform (back then before pandemic.) </p>


	
<h3>Goals in life / pangarap sa buhay</h3>

<p>My goals are number one, having my own art gallery which I can showcase my art style and give inspiration to people and<br>
 number 2 to make it to Broadway.</p>
